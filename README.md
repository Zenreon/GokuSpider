A fork of Bizzlemip's mod to replace the Spider with a png of Goku instead of the Bracken.

Requires BepInEx and LC_API

To install, grab the latest release and extract into your game folder with Lethal Company.exe

The release also includes the required assetbundle, which is directly from bizzlemip's release of her mod found 
on thunderstore. If you would like to build your own, I recommend using bizzlemip's unity project as a base found on their mod's github page.
