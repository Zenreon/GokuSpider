Im really new to github and couldnt figure out how to upload the utilized unity project here so heres a google drive link to it https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xfTQGkhlsYafSvGJ-kAtMpZWz4B00IzM/view?usp=sharing (sorry internet archivist in 2030 XD)

When youre ready to build the project, use the assetbundle browser in the Window tab to build the assetbundles, then put the assetbundles in LethalCompany/BepInEx/Bundles
